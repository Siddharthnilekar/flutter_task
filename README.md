# ðŸ’³ Flutter Interview Assignment: Bank App with Transaction Module

This repository contains a **Flutter Host App** (`bank_app`) and a **Flutter Module** (`transaction_module`) created as part of an interview assignment.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate **modular architecture** and **bidirectional data transfer** using Flutter's `Add-to-App` approach with seamless UI/UX integration.
