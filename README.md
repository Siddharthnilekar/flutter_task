As part of the interview, the following was implemented:

- Created a **Flutter Host App** (`bank_app`) and a **Flutter Module** (`transaction_module`)

- Used `Navigator.push()` and `Navigator.pop()` for data communication
- Ensured proper **lifecycle management** within Flutter’s widget tree
- Provided a **working APK** and a **demo video**
